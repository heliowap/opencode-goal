# Coding standards

## Architecture

- `src/goal.ts` owns every state rule in the pure reducer `step(goal, event, now) -> { goal, effect }`. Add behavior as a new `GoalEvent` or `GoalEffect` variant and a reducer case. The reducer takes `now` as an argument and does no I/O.
- `src/index.ts` is a thin adapter: it turns OpenCode events, the `/goal` command, and tool calls into `GoalEvent`s, then runs the returned `GoalEffect`. Every state change goes through `transition`, which holds the semaphore across load, step, save, and perform, and emits the `goal.changed` RPC event.
- `src/tui.tsx` is the terminal entrypoint. It reads the goal only through the `goal` RPC (`src/rpc.ts`) and renders `goalBadge` from `src/badge.ts`. Keep display rules in `badge.ts`, where unit and mutation tests reach them.
- `src/command.ts` parses `/goal` arguments into a `GoalCommand` union. `src/prompts.ts` renders `templates/*.md` and formats status text.
- Model data as tagged unions with `_tag` and `switch` exhaustively. Persisted data is an Effect `Schema`, decoded with `decodeGoal` at the storage boundary.

## Effect and the plugin API

- Use the Effect entry point `@opencode/plugin/effect` with `Effect.gen`. Register transforms, hooks, and the event stream inside the plugin scope so unload disposes them.
- Declare tool inputs as plain JSON Schema through `toolInput(schema)` and decode inside `execute`. OpenCode rejected valid input against an Effect `Schema.Int` passed directly.
- Fail tools with `Tool.Error` and a message the model can act on.
- Isolate each event handler with `catchCause` so one bad event cannot stop the stream.
- Act only on goals whose `directory` matches `ctx.location.directory` (`ownedGoal`). Several plugin instances, one per location, see the same events.
- Synthetic messages: `resume: true` starts a turn, `delivery: "steer"` lands in the running turn, `"queue"` waits for the next one. Route continuations through `drive`, which sends at most one per turn.

## Persistence

- State lives in `ctx.storage` under `goal/<sessionID>`. Changing the `Goal` schema makes old records decode to `undefined`, which reads as "no goal". Accept that or migrate in `decodeGoal`.

## Prompts and text

- All text the user or model reads is English.
- Prompts live in `templates/` with `{{placeholder}}` slots. Pass the objective through `escapeXml`, since it is user data inside `<objective>` tags.
- `templates/continuation.md`, `budget_limit.md`, `objective_updated.md`, and the tool descriptions are adapted from OpenAI Codex under Apache-2.0. When you change them, keep `NOTICE` accurate.

## Comments

Keep a comment only for a non-obvious why, such as a host quirk. State the observed fact, and leave out guesses about causes.

## Tests

- Test behavior: call `step`, `parseCommand`, and the prompt functions the way the plugin does, and assert against literal expected values with `toEqual`.
- Every reducer branch has a test. A new event or effect ships with its tests.
- `bun test` and `bun run typecheck` pass before every commit.
- `bun run mutation` keeps a 100% mutation score on `src/goal.ts`, `src/command.ts`, `src/prompts.ts`, and `src/badge.ts`. A surviving mutant means a missing test or redundant code: add the test, or delete the code. Do not exclude mutants.

## Host canaries

Changes to `src/index.ts` or event handling need a host canary in `host/`. A canary starts a real `opencode serve` through `host/harness/host.ts` with a scripted fixture provider (`host/harness/fixture.ts`). Grade it on `host.stored(session)`, files on disk, and `host.fixture.agentRequests()`. Assert exact counts and values. A bug fix lands with a canary or unit test that fails before the fix. Add new canary files to the CI matrix in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

## Manual end-to-end checks

For checks against your own running service:

- The service hot-reloads the plugin through the `~/.config/opencode/plugins/goal.ts` symlink, so saving `src/` changes every live session. Running `opencode service restart` from inside an OpenCode session kills that session too.
- `opencode run` sends `/goal ...` as plain text. Invoke the command with `opencode api post /api/session/<id>/command --data '{"name":"goal","text":"..."}'`.
- Run each scenario in its own temp directory and session. Read the outcome from `opencode session export <id>` and `opencode api get /api/session/<id>/inbox`.
