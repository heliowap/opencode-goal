# Compatibility and evidence

Every claim here comes from a real `opencode serve` process with no mocked plugin hooks. Each run uses isolated `HOME` and `XDG_*` directories. Results are graded on state the plugin cannot narrate: the goal stored in `opencode.db` (table `kv`, key `plugin:<id>:goal/<sessionID>`), files on disk, test exit codes, and the requests the plugin sent. Model prose is not evidence.

## Host canaries (deterministic)

`host/*.test.ts` runs OpenCode 2.0.24 against a scripted OpenAI-compatible fixture provider (`host/harness/fixture.ts`). The fixture controls each reply, its timing, errors, and the exact token usage, so these results reproduce on every run. CI runs one runner per file on Linux. They also pass locally on macOS arm64.

| # | Scenario | Result | Graded on |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | `/goal` registers and `goal_create`, `goal_get`, `goal_update` reach the model | ✅ | `/api/command`, tools in the captured request |
| A2 | The goal continues turn after turn and stops once completed | ✅ | stored `complete` with note, `a.txt`/`b.txt` contents, exactly 3 continuations and 6 model requests |
| A3 | Text-only turns keep the goal going | ✅ | stored `complete`, `emptyTurns: 0`, 3 continuations |
| A4 | Three empty turns block the goal | ✅ | stored `blocked`, `emptyTurns: 3`, exactly 3 model requests |
| A5 | Crossing a 10K budget limits the goal and steers one wrap-up | ✅ | stored `budget_limited`, `tokensUsed: 16000` with 4,000-token steps, exactly 1 wrap-up |
| A5b | The step that calls `goal_update` is charged | ✅ after #2 | stored `tokensUsed: 4000` for a one-step goal |
| A5c | Crossing the budget in a turn already steered by `/goal edit` still steers the wrap-up | ✅ after #9 | stored `budget_limited`, `tokensUsed: 360`, exactly 1 wrap-up request |
| A6 | `/goal edit` mid-turn steers that turn and keeps usage | ✅ | stored new objective, `tokensUsed: 240`, escaped objective in the steered request |
| A7a | Interrupt pauses, resume continues | ✅ | stored `paused` with note, then `complete` |
| A7b | `/goal pause` mid-turn starts no other turn | ✅ | stored `paused`, exactly 2 model requests (the second answers the pause notice) |
| A8 | A provider error blocks instead of looping | ✅ | stored `blocked` with the error, exactly 1 model request |
| A9 | `plan`-agent turns neither count nor continue | ✅ | stored `active`, `tokensUsed: 0`, one continuation in the last request |
| A10 | Tools refuse a second goal and impossible transitions | ✅ | exact tool results, stored `blocked` |
| A11 | The objective reaches the model escaped | ✅ | captured request text |
| A12a | A paused goal survives a server restart unchanged | ✅ | stored goal identical before and after |
| A12b | An active goal cut off by a server death comes back paused | ✅ after #3 | stored `paused` with recovery note, then `complete` after resume |
| A12c | A location reload leaves a running goal active | ✅ | stored `complete` without user action |
| A12d | A location reload during a `plan` turn keeps that turn uncounted | ✅ after #10 | stored `tokensUsed: 0`, `emptyTurns: 0` |
| A13 | Deleting a session removes its goal | ✅ | no stored goal, exactly one `goal.changed` with `goal: null` |
| A16 | A goal follows its session to a new directory | ✅ after #11 | stored `directory` updated, then `complete` after resume there |
| A14 | The plugin installed from its package spec works | ✅ | stored `complete`. CI installs `github:<repo>#<commit under test>` |
| A15 | `goal.get` RPC returns the stored goal and `goal.changed` fires on each transition | ✅ | RPC output equals the `kv` row, events read from `/api/event` |
| T1 | The line above the input shows running with usage, then paused, then nothing after clear | ✅ | real `opencode` terminal in tmux, screen text above the input |
| T2 | The line shows active between turns (`plan` agent), blocked, and budget reached | ✅ | same, with the stored status checked first |

T1 and T2 start the real `opencode` terminal client against the canary server inside tmux, then read the line directly above the input with `tmux capture-pane`. CI runs them twice: once with the linked source, and once with the plugin installed from the commit under test (`tui-package`). The installed run caught a bug the linked run could not see. An installed package resolves `solid-js` to its own copy, which the host renderer does not track, so the line stayed empty. The status line now keeps its state in the host's `context.storage.memory` store and imports nothing from `solid-js`.

The canaries found three bugs, each fixed test-first: #1, #2, #3. A later code review found five more, fixed the same way: #9, #10, #11, #12, #13.

## Live models

`host/live/live.test.ts` runs the same harness against real providers, with all permissions allowed in the isolated config. Run on OpenCode 2.0.24, macOS arm64, 2026-10-06.

```sh
LIVE_MODEL="cli_proxy_google/gemini-3.8-flash#low" bun test ./host/live/live.test.ts
```

| Scenario | `devin/swe-2#medium` | `gemini-3.8-flash#low` | `opencode/nemotron-3.5-lightning-free` |
|---|---|---|---|
| L1 fix a failing test, complete with evidence | ✅ 19.3K tokens, 1 continuation | ✅ 66.6K, 3 | ✅ 72.5K, 2 |
| L2 one file per turn until three exist | ✅ 40.4K, 3 continuations | ✅ 107.1K, 3 | ⚠️ goal met (files correct, `complete`), but the model wrote all three files in one turn in both runs. In the first run its completion note claimed "Each file was created in a separate turn". |
| L3 stop at a 40K budget with one wrap-up | ✅ stopped at 54.9K | ✅ stopped at 55.3K | ✅ stopped at 61.5K |
| L4 pause, restart the server, resume, finish | ✅ 82.6K, state identical across restart | ✅ 115.3K, identical | ✅ 79.6K, identical (second run; the first hit a harness fetch timeout, since fixed) |

L1 is graded by running `bun test` ourselves (exit 0) and checking that `sum.test.ts` is byte-identical. L3 is graded on `budget_limited`, exactly one wrap-up message, and no continuation after it.

Sessions: swe-2 L1 `ses_eeef3b56bffeJg94Uk67o84d8R`, L2 `ses_eeef37efdffeu1K0UjBJqVu6S4`, L3 `ses_eeef333eeffeRXXMu16btlHRSh`, L4 `ses_eeef2bedaffe2vXZDZ6B380asx`. Gemini L1 `ses_eeef3b58affeqO6jV1DiOgpZms`, L2 `ses_eeef318b9ffeyAvsRVio8wQkeY`, L3 `ses_eeef2796effemwjMmKouR0L8j9`, L4 `ses_eeef21e99ffevfwjhnL8457yfN`. Nemotron L1 `ses_eeef3b570ffeKzh32XAL3i6PQ6`, L2 `ses_eeef1d153ffe4AsfzqeN9XYPBk` and `ses_eeeeade5affef3Kk6RUjaWd1E1`, L3 `ses_eeef11b59ffezTNeKOeXQ7Yuei`, L4 `ses_eeee9f9feffe8t7JmL3LXsFUXF`. The isolated data directories were deleted after each run, so these IDs identify runs in the results log, not sessions you can open.

## Budgets overshoot

The budget is checked when each model step ends, so the step that crosses it and the wrap-up turn still run. With 4,000-token steps, a 10K budget ends at 16K (A5). With real models and a 40K budget the goal ended between 54.9K and 61.5K (+37% to +54%). Set budgets well above the cost of one turn.
