Codex-style `/goal` for OpenCode 2. A persistent, per-session objective that keeps the agent working across turns until completion is audited against evidence.

## Install

Requires OpenCode 2.

```sh
opencode plugin add github:heliowap/opencode-v2-goal-plugin
```

This installs the plugin and adds it to your global `opencode.jsonc`. If `/goal` does not show up, run `opencode service restart`. Update with `opencode plugin update` and uninstall with `opencode plugin remove github:heliowap/opencode-v2-goal-plugin`.

## Compatibility

| Surface | Status |
|---|---|
| OpenCode 2.0.24 | Verified by 26 host canaries against a real `opencode serve`, graded on stored state. They run in CI on every push. |
| Status above the input (terminal UI) | Verified by 2 canaries that drive the real `opencode` terminal in tmux and read the screen |
| Headless `opencode run` | Works against a running server (`--server` or the background service). With `--standalone` the goal stops after the first turn, see [Headless runs](#headless-runs) |
| Live models | `devin/swe-2`, `gemini-3.8-flash`, and the free `nemotron-3.5-lightning-free` complete real goals, stop at budgets, and survive a restart |
| `/goal` typed in the terminal UI, desktop and web apps, Windows, other OpenCode versions | Not established |

Details, session evidence, and what is not proven: [`docs/compatibility.md`](docs/compatibility.md).

## Use

```text
/goal make the checkout suite pass without changing the public API
/goal --tokens 250K migrate the tests from Jest to Vitest
/goal --verify "bun test" make the checkout suite pass
/goal                    show status and token usage
/goal edit <objective>   change the objective, keeping usage
/goal pause
/goal resume
/goal clear
```

In the terminal UI, a line above the input shows the goal of the open session:

| Goal | Line |
|---|---|
| Active, turn running | `◎ goal running · 12K / 50K` |
| Active, between turns | `◎ goal active · 12K / 50K` |
| Paused | `⏸ goal paused` |
| Blocked | `⚠ goal blocked` |
| Out of budget | `goal budget reached · 52K / 50K` |
| Complete, or no goal | nothing |

The agent can also create, read, and finish goals with the `goal_create`, `goal_get`, and `goal_update` tools. `goal_get` also returns the `/goal` syntax, so the agent can answer questions about the command.

## How it works

- State lives in the plugin's `ctx.storage` under `goal/<sessionID>` and survives restarts.
- When a turn ends with the goal `active`, the plugin sends a synthetic continuation message that starts the next turn. The message carries the full instructions: keep the scope intact, work from current evidence, check for progress, and audit completion requirement by requirement before calling `goal_update`.
- Three consecutive turns with no text and no tool use mark the goal `blocked`, so it cannot spin.
- The model may mark the goal `blocked` only after the same blocker repeats for three turns, and `paused` only at the user's request.
- Token usage is counted from each model step (input, output, and reasoning tokens). Crossing `--tokens` marks the goal `budget_limited` and steers the agent to wrap up.
- With `--verify "cmd"`, `goal_update` with `complete` first runs `cmd` with `sh -c` in the goal's directory. The goal completes only if it exits 0. Otherwise the goal stays open, the plugin counts the failed check, and the model gets the exit code and the end of the output. Interrupting the turn kills the command. Only the user can set the command: `goal_create` cannot, because a plugin tool cannot ask for `bash` permission per call.
- A user interrupt pauses the goal. A failed turn blocks it so retries cannot loop.
- Turns run by the `plan` agent neither count nor continue the goal.

All state rules live in the pure reducer `step` in `src/goal.ts`. `src/index.ts` only translates OpenCode events into `GoalEvent`s and runs the returned `GoalEffect`.

## Headless runs

`opencode run` returns when its first turn ends. The server keeps continuing the goal after that, so a headless goal needs a server that outlives the command. `opencode run --standalone` stops its private server on exit, and the goal stops with it; it comes back paused the next time a server starts.

For CI, start a server, create the goal through `opencode run --server`, and poll the goal until it leaves `active`:

```sh
opencode serve --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port 4096 &
id=$(opencode run --server http://127.0.0.1:4096 --format json "Set a goal: <objective>" | grep -o '"sessionID":"ses_[^"]*"' | head -1 | cut -d'"' -f4)
until opencode api --server http://127.0.0.1:4096 post "/api/rpc/goal/get?location[directory]=$PWD" \
  -d "{\"input\":{\"sessionID\":\"$id\"}}" | grep -qv '"status":"active"'; do sleep 10; done
```

## Known limitation

Replies to `/goal`, `pause`, `resume`, `edit`, and `clear` are queued as synthetic messages. When the session is idle they show up at the start of the next turn, not immediately.

## Attribution

The prompts in `templates/` and the tool descriptions are adapted from the `/goal` extension in [OpenAI Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex/tree/main/codex-rs/ext/goal), licensed under Apache-2.0. They were modified to use OpenCode tool names. See `NOTICE`.

## Develop

Requires Bun. Clone the repository and load your checkout instead of the published package:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/heliowap/opencode-v2-goal-plugin.git
cd opencode-v2-goal-plugin
bun install
opencode plugin remove github:heliowap/opencode-v2-goal-plugin   # if installed, so only one goal plugin loads
ln -sfn "$PWD/src" ~/.config/opencode/plugins/goal
```

The directory link loads both entrypoints: `src/index.ts` on the server and `src/tui.tsx` in the terminal. If you previously linked the single file `~/.config/opencode/plugins/goal.ts`, remove it and run `opencode service restart` before adding the directory link. OpenCode 2.0.24 fails to load a directory that replaces a single-file plugin of the same name in a running service, with `Cannot find package '@opencode/plugin'`.

OpenCode reloads the plugin when you save files under `src/`.

```sh
bun test                      # unit tests, 100% line and function coverage enforced
bun run typecheck
bun run mutation              # mutation testing: every mutant of goal.ts, command.ts, prompts.ts, badge.ts, format.ts must be killed
bun test ./host               # host canaries: needs `opencode` 2.0.24 on PATH
LIVE_MODEL="<provider>/<model>" bun test ./host/live/live.test.ts   # live models, uses your provider config
```
